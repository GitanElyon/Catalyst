# Catalyst
Catalyst is a free lightweight IDE designed to expidite the process of idea to product.

# But Why?
I have been plauged for the longest time by IDEs that claim to be lightwieght, then take up all my RAM (I'm looking at you VSC). And while there are many lightweight options, none of them really have the feature pool I am looking for, so I set out to build my own.

Catalyst aims to solve all of these problems by providing a clean, lightweight developing expirence.
